## Interview Overview

1.**不求无错，但求比人好**

2.真实的面试题和学术算法书上的很不一样

3.algorithm questions, behavioral questions, trivia questions.

6.screening interview(phone): write on paper and read it back over the phone. on-site: 4~6 in-person interviews (one lunch interview, not technical)

7.prior experience(留下好印象 interviewer 会认为你聪明而忽略小错误), culture fit, coding skills, analytical ability

- 做一个好相处的人
- 关于简历的问题必须准备
- 主要关注算法题
- Practicing without a compiler
- Behavior questions really matters: impression! 
- Mock interview
- Don't memorize solutions. Solve problems all by yourself. Quality beats quantity.
- 把脑海中的想法说出来，不沟通=没进展
- take your time
- 编程好风格
- 测试
- 仔细改错
- 不害怕
- TODO??告诉面试官这题我见过

## Interview Questions

[Solutions with C++ at github.com](https://github.com/puncsky/playground/tree/master/careercup)

- Runner technique for linked list: iterate through the linked list with two (fast and slow) pointers simultaneously. 
- All recursive algorithms can be implemented iteratively.

- `x & (~0 << n)` clears the n rightmost bits of x. `~0` is not 1 but 111...1.

### 6 Brain teasers

start talking, and showing how you tackle the problem. Write down the rules you have found.

### 9 Recursion and DP

- Buttom-up recursion, start with a simple case
- Top-down recursion, how to divide the problem for case N into subproblems
- DP
	- rarely asked
	- solve like recursion. The ***only difference*** is that intermediate results are cached for future calls
- discuss the trade-offs between recursive & iterative solutions with your interview

### 10 Scalability and Memory Limits

- 理想情况 -> 实际情况 -> 解决问题
- Typical Capacity:
	- Hard Drive Space
	- Memory
	- Internet Transfer Latency
	
### Databases

- Normalized: minimize redundancy. 
- Denormalized: optimize read time.
