Travel in person is of no importance to me at all.

Surely I have already known that the world is wonderful and full of unexpected surprises. Like many other groups of people, travel around the world is also one of my childhood dreams. Wandering around leads to stumbling upon. Travel is admittedly the right way to discover ["the black swan"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory), in which an unpredictable slight event can make a significant difference. 

However, 

It is the people I travel with that really matters to me.
